        <h5>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h5>

        <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <h5>The team was very<br>supportive and kept me<br>motivated</h5>

        <p>“ I started as a total newbie with<br>virtually no coding skills. I now<br>work as a mobile engineer
        for a<br>big company. This was one of the<br>best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

        <h5>Such a life-changing<br>experience. Highly<br>recommended!</h5>
      
        <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br>never written a line of code. I needed<br>some structure from
          professionals<br>who can help me learn programming<br>step by step. I was encouraged to<br>enroll by a former
          student of theirs<br>who can only say wonderful things<br>about the program. The entire<br>curriculum and staff
          did not<br>disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>and I never had to wait long for<br>assistance. The agile team
          project, in<br>particular, was outstanding. It took<br>my learning to the next level in a way<br>that no tutorial
          could ever have. In<br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br>interviews as an example of my<br>developent
          experience. It certainly<br>helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>developer after receiving multiple<br>offers.
          100% recommend! ”</p>

        <h5>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
        learning from their experiences was easy.</h5>

        <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
